##Extending the Form

Your piece is currently in A - B - A form. You are free to extend your form by adding any number of sections. For example, you could make a new section and have a form that is A - B - A -C - A. It's up to you!


Regardless of your form we will include an Ending Section and an Introduction to our composition. 


###How to Make an Ending Tip

We will explore a few common techniques for making an ending to your piece. One important tip is this:

>However you choose to end your piece you want to make it very obvious to the listener that your piece is ending!


How can we do this...?


###End on the Home Chord
For your piece to sound complete it can be helpful to end on the home chord (tonic chord). Determine if your piece is in C major or some other key and have your final harmony use the notes of your tonic chord. For example the C Major chord (c-e-g).

###Repeat Melody 3 Times
A very common technique for creating an ending is to repeat the last phrase of your main melody 3 times while witholding the final note until the final statement of the melody.

###Use the Rit... Symbol
A ritardando is a common way to gradually slow the tempo down at the end of your piece. This symbol can be found under the Lines menu in Noteflight. One thing to be aware of is that Noteflight currently will not slow down the tempo during playback when it sees a Ritardando. Use your imagination for this one and know that the real musicians will slow down.
