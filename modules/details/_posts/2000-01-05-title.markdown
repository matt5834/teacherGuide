Selecting a thoughtful title for a composition is an important task for every composer. The title serves to help give your listener an impression of what the music might sound like. A great title will actually start the listening experience for the audience before the first note is played!

Choose a title that capture the mood or spirit of your piece. Is there some kind of story that your music conveys? Go to your composition and give it a great title.
