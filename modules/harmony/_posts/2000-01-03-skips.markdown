##Leaps = Consonance or Dissonance?

As you may have noticed there is another option for adding a harmony note. Instead of a Step or a Skip you could of course add a note that is a Leap above or below the melody note. The Leap that we are concerned about here is not simply "anything more than a skip."  These leaps are intervals that are 2 Skips or a Skip **plus** a Step. These intervals, if flipped, can be seen as a skip. 

For example:


C below G (2 Skips) could be spelled as G below C (Skip plus a Step).  For simplicity let's refer to this Leap interval only as **2-Skips.**

___
While 2-Skips do not sound so much like a clash they are more ambiguous than a Skip. We will treat 2-Skips as
dissonances not because they clash but because they are too "open" sounding. Apply the same rules to 2-Skips as you would to Steps:


+ Resolve a 2-Skip interval to a Skip interval on the very next note.


+ Do not have two 2-Skip intervals in a row.


+ Do not leap to a 2-Skip interval.
