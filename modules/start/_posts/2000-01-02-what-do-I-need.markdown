##What do I need for this course?

You'll need the following items for this course:

1. Your own Noteflight account (free!)
2. A YCIW account (also free!)

###Noteflight Account
Noteflight is a revolutionary web application that allows users to compose in a web browser. It's like Finale or Sibelius but each score is a web page. What makes it even more awesome and great for teachers is that each score is shareable just like a Google Doc.  
To sign up for your own Noteflight account visit [Noteflight.com](http://www.noteflight.com) and click sign up. If you already have your own Noteflight account you may use that!

###YCIW Account
You'll need to sign up at our main website [yciw.net](http://www.yciw.net/1/) in order to access the community forum and to view some of the other course material. Don't worry it is easy and totally free!
