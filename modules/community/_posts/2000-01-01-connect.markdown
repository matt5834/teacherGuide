# Community of Teachers, Composers and Musicians
As you work through each part of this course you'll connect with other teachers. A big part of YCIW's success is due to our community or teachers, composers and musicians. Each concept and activity has a corresponding discussion thread for you to give feedback as well as read about the suggestions and best practices of other teachers. Think of it as a living professional development resource. 

# Discourse Community
You'll be posting on various threads at our [YCIW Community.](http://discourse.yciw.net) Be sure to login with the same credentials that you use for yciw.net.
