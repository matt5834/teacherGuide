#Post Observations and Questions About Your Students
For many teachers taking this course will happen simultaneously with using the YCIW curriculum with students. **Post observations and give feedback on how your students are doing with each lesson step.** Read through the feedback from other teachers as a way to learn best practices and improve the experience for your students. 


###Classroom Activities
You'll find a number of classroom activities that you can try with your students. These activities are designed to help the student **experience** the concept that they are using in their composition. We believe that the combined experience of performing the concept along with using it in their composition leads to mastery. Feel free to share your own ideas for classroom activities.
