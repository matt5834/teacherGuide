###inHarmony
Excellent app for performing a chord progression and a diatonic melody simultaneously. An intuitive way for students to play chord tones based on scale degrees. [inHarmony](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inharmony/id526295009?mt=8)


###Chordion
Similar to inHarmony with its ability to perform chords and melodies simultaneously. Chordion offers slightly less control in terms of melodic note choices. Also a great MIDI controller when used with OSC. [Chordion](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chordion-musical-instrument/id552182095?mt=8)
