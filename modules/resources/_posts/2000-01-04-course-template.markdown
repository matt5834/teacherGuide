>Most of these terms are second nature for the music teacher. Some of them are particular to the YCIW curriculum in a way that helps promote the "sound-before-theory" method. The definition of each term is stated in a way that reflects how it is used in the curriculum. This list can serve as an important collection of terms to be shared with students. 


###Form
The ordering of sections of music within one composition. For example, an A section may be followed by a B seciton. If a song has an A section then a B section followed by a repeat of the A section then it's *form* would be: A - B - A.


###Harmony
Any two or more sounds ocurring at the same moment in time. 

###Harmony Rule 1
* Letters of the musical alphabet 1 STEP apart when sounded together are considered a *dissonance.*
* Letters of the musical alphabet 1 SKIP apart when sounded together are considered a *consonance.*
* Letters of the musical alphabet 2 SKIPS apart are considered to be *open* and need to be resolved. 



###Leaps
Notes that move from one letter of the musical alphabet to another letter that is **more** than a skip away. For example, G to D or F to C. 


###Melodic Shape
Every melody has a shape. If each note in a melody were connected by a line it would reveal it's melodic shape. 

###Musical Alphabet
The musical alphabet has only six letters: A B C D E F G  Using these letters we can build any number of chords and melodies.


###Resolution
The movement from a dissonant harmony to a consonant harmony. 


###Singable, Memorable Melody
There are many kinds of melodies and many ways that a melody can be memorable. One way to create a melody that is memorable is to apply a smooth melodic shape to a rhythm that can be sung. Melodies that use mostly STEPS, with occassional SKIPS and LEAPS have a smooth melodic shape. 


###Skips
Notes that move from one letter of the musical alphabet to another letter while skipping over just one letter. For example, C to E or G to B. (Skips displaced by an octave are considered LEAPS in the context of melodies but **not harmonies**.)


###Steps
Notes that move from one letter of the musical alphabet to the very next letter of the musical alphabet. For example, G to A, or F to E.  (Steps displaced by an octave are considered LEAPS in the context of melodies but **not harmonies**.)
