# Projects

## How others do it

[Why Open](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/), [Writing for Change](http://writing4change.p2pu.org) or [Play With Your Music](http://playwithyourmusic.org) are good examples to look at.

- How did people give feedback to each other on the work they did?
- Did the course use badges?

Have a look at the following badges: [WikiSOO Burba Badge](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/22/), [Deeper Learning](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/323/) or [I Walked with #WALKMYWORLD](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/347/).

- What courses were they part of?
- Did the course they were part of include other badges?
- Did learners give each other feedback on projects?


## Feedback in your course

What type of feedback do you wish to facilitate in your courses.



## Create badges for your course

Design a badge for every project in your course. You can create a badge on [badges.p2pu.org](https://badges.p2pu.org). For in depth details on creating badges, you should see our [course on creating a badge](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/653/content/1254/) for your course.

To add your badges to your course, you should grab the embed code from the badges page by clicking on the embed button and paste the code into a seperate section in your module called badges.

This is an example of what the embed code looks like:

{% highlight html %}
<iframe id="badge_embed" type="text/html" frameborder="0" height="310" width="210" src="//badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/3/embedded/?rendering=normal"></iframe>
{% endhighlight %}
